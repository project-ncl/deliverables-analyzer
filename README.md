# Deliverables Analyzer

Deliverables Analyzer is a RESTful Web Service that uses the
[Build Finder](https://github.com/project-ncl/build-finder) library to
scan a given URL containing a software distribution and return the list
of builds.

## Endpoints

### Analyze

The main way to use the service is as follows:

- Perform an HTTP POST passing the `url` of a *deliverable* to
  `/api/analyze`. A *deliverable* should be an archive, such as a `.zip`
  or `.jar` file, which contains a product version. For example, if your
  product is `jbossfoo` and your version is `1.0`, then you might have a
  file called `jbossfoo-1.0.zip` to analyze. The `url` must be using
  protocol `http` or `https`. You may also optionally set `config` to
  override some of the default configuration settings. The `config` is
  the JSON representation of
  `org.jboss.pnc.build.finder.core.BuildConfig`.
- The `/api/analyze` endpoint will return the status code `201 Created`
  with a `Location` header. The location will be set to
  `/api/analyze/results/<id>` where `<id>` is an identifier
  corresponding to the `url`. The results will be cached, but will
  eventually expire. You may fetch the configuration used by accessing
  the `/api/analyze/configs/<id>` endpoint.
- The `/api/analyze/results/<id>` endpoint will return status code `404
  Not Found` if `<id>` doesn't exist. It will return `503 Service
  Unavailable` if the results exist, but are not yet ready. It will
  return `200 OK` if the results exist and are ready. In case there is
  an error getting the results, it will return `500 Server Error`.
- The `/api/analyze/statuses/<id>` endpoint will return the current
  status (percent done) of the analysis and may be polled once the
  analysis has started.

### Health

The service supports the MicroProfile `/q/health` endpoint (and also
`/q/health/live` and `/q/health/ready`).

### Version

The service will reply to `/api/version` with a version string in
plaintext containing information about the service as well as the
version of [Build Finder](https://github.com/project-ncl/build-finder)
being used.

## Building with Maven

To build with Maven and run the tests:

```
$ mvn -Ddistribution.url=<url> clean install
```

## Configuration

Deliverables Analyzer can be configured by setting the various configuration
keys listed below. They can be defined by setting the configuration key in:

- system property (`-Dkey=value`)
- environment variable
- `.env` file in the working directory
- `application.properties` file

| Configuration Key | Description                                                          | Example                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| koji.hub.url      | The Koji Hub URL to find builds                                      | http://brewhub.localhost/brewhub |
| koji.web.url      | The Koji Web URL                                                     | http://brewweb.localhost/brew    |
| pnc.url           | The PNC URL to find builds                                           | http://pnc.localhost             |
| infinispan.mode   | Define whether to use Infinispan in `EMBEDDED` (default) or `REMOTE` | `EMBEDDED`                       |

### Remote Infinispan

If the `infinispan.mode` is set to `REMOTE`, the following configuration keys need to be defined:

| Configuration Key                  | Description                                                    | Example         |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| quarkus.infinispan-client.hosts    | Comma-delimited Infinispan server list (\<hostname>[:\<port>]) | localhost:11222 |
| quarkus.infinispan-client.username | Username for the Infinispan server                             | admin           |
| quarkus.infinispan-client.password | Password for the Infinispan server                             | password        |

The following caches also need to be present in the Infinispan server:

- builds
- builds-pnc
- checksums-md5
- checksums-pnc-md5
- checksums-pnc-sha1
- checksums-pnc-sha256
- checksums-sha1
- checksums-sha256
- files-md5
- files-sha1
- files-sha256
- rpms-md5
- rpms-sha1
- rpms-sha256

### OpenTelemetry

| Configuration Key                   | Description                             | Example                                                                |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint | OTLP endpoint to send telemetry data to | http://localhost:4317                                                  |
| quarkus.otel.resource.attributes    | Attributes to add to the exported trace | "service.name=pnc-deliverable-analyzer,deployment.environment=staging" |

## Creating Docker Images with Docker Compose

To also build the Docker image, add `-Pdocker` to the `mvn` arguments.

This is the equivalent of manually running:

```
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up --build
$ docker-compose down --rmi --remove-orphans -v
```
